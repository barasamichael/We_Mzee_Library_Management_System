Current System
In the current system, the authors and their books are registered with the library by the administrator. Borrowers either self-registered or are registered by the administrator.
Borrowers are provided a limit beyond which they can no longer borrow until at least one borrowed book is returned.
Upon returning of the book, the administrator confirms whether the book is in good condition and the due date is not exceeded. If the book is returned in a poor condition, relevant fines are charged. If it is overdue, the number of days is multiplied against the charges per day. These values are subject to constant review. Administrator may decide to delete a book, deactivate a book (not borrowable), deactivate/suspend/remove a borrower and remove an author.
